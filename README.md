# Death Of A Deal

Hallowville’s grand abandoned mansion is a sanctuary for the town’s abundant ghost population. When
a bold real-estate agent attempts to finalize a deal with a client in its halls, you spring to life
as the haunted guardian angel statue, scaring the pair in every room to thwart the deal, all the
while evading the agent’s gaze.

## Features

- Lug your way through the map, all the while concealing yourself as a statue in accordance with the
  others’ gaze
- Rush to the real-estate agent and scare away all clients before they complete the tour
- Maximize your movement’s payoff by recalling when the people turn around to look at you
- Leverage the attributes of your surroundings to your benefit

## How to play the gameplay prototype

The basic controls are using the arrow keys to move and using the up arrow to jump.

There are two main game modes for our current gameplay prototype. The first is the "meter mode",
where you need to manage the status of a suspicion meter, and you become frozen when the meter
reaches 100. The second main game mode we have is where you get to control the freezing mechanic
entirely. To activate this mode, press `x` to stop the timer and then `m` so you gain density when
you freeze. Try playing around in this mode to hit the bounce pad and slide down the slope while
frozen. To freeze in this game mode, press `f`.

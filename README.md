# Death Of A Deal

Hallowville’s grand abandoned mansion is a sanctuary for the town’s abundant ghost population. When
a bold real-estate agent attempts to finalize a deal with a client in its halls, you spring to life
as the haunted guardian angel statue, scaring the pair in every room to thwart the deal, all the
while evading the agent’s gaze.

## Features

- Lug your way through the map, all the while concealing yourself as a statue in accordance with the
  others’ gaze
- Rush to the real-estate agent and scare away all clients before they complete the tour
- Maximize your movement’s payoff by recalling when the people turn around to look at you
- Leverage the attributes of your surroundings to your benefit

## How to play the technical prototype

The basic controls are using the arrow keys to move and using the up arrow to jump. You can
press `f` to freeze your character, which will cause your character to become much heavier, at the
expense of losing movement control.

Our technical prototype contains 3 main levels to demonstrate our various mechanics. You press `n`
to decrement the level counter and `p` to increment the level counter. A description of each level
is as follows: <br /><br />
L0 - This level is mainly showing off the bounce pad mechanic. Each of the dark platforms are bounce
pads. You can only bounce on them when frozen however. This is a more difficult level and we
recommend playing L1 first.
<details><summary>Hint for completing L0</summary>Try using the freeze mechanic to slide into the
horizontal bounce pad on the left.</details>

 <br /> <br />
L1 - This level is pretty basic, you slide on the slopes to reach the finish. The only unintuitive 
thing could be the bounce pad at the end that you have to repeatedly bounce on to get to the finish.
 <br /> <br />
L2 - This level introduces 2 new mechanics, the fan and the breakable platforms. The fan will act as
a strong wind force, which will push you more when you're lighter. This is represented by the
platform that has the semi-transparent film coming out of it. The breakable platform is under the 
first fan, and you can only break through it if you have high enough velocity.

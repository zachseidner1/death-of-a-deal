  This should be a customizable slope, so it would be good if we could have 3 vertices and then
  a platform would be created based off of that. I think you could try using BoxObstacle to
  implement this, but if you find a better way feel free to do so.

  Also you will need to add some of your own JSON parsing code and JSON properties for the sloped
  platform.
